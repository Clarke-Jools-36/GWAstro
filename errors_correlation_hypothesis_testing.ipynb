        "If we look at standard probability tables (see table below), the probability of randomly finding a correlation between two variables with coefficient of $r \\ge 0.7$ for a sample of $N=3$ is 51% **even if 2 variables are uncorrelated**.  Therefore we need to combine any $r$ correlation value with some measure of the probability of getting that value just by random given the number of data points you have.  We will return to this in Chapter 5.\n",

Instead, we will see something at later which can allow us to look for correlations without assuming a Gaussian distribution."

Are an observed population of low-mass galaxies consistent with the predictions from $\\Lambda$CDM? Did CERN really detect the Higg's Boson? We'll start this section by outlining the formal ideas behind hypothesis testing, and then look at some classic examples.\n",

        "The most common form of hypothesis testing is  involves trying to find the unknown parameter $\\theta$ that is part of a model $f(\\theta)$. Now you might have a best guess for the unknown parameter, and an associated uncertainty, so really we're not always testing if $\\theta$ is an exact value, but more generally whether $\\theta \\in \\Theta$, that is $\\theta$ is part of some set of possible values $\\Theta$. From our best guess of $\\theta$, what we're trying to determine is whether $\\theta \\in \\Theta_0$ or $\\theta \\in \\Theta_1$, and where,\n",

We also know the probability of the model predicting the data, which is given by $p(X, \\theta)$.\n",

The alternative hypothesis is where the action is i.e. some observation/ phenomenon is real (i.e. not a fluke) and statistical analysis will give us more insights on that.  The null hypothesis is saying that one variable does not affect the other and anything we see in our results are due to chance and are not significant in terms of supporting the idea being investigated. Thus, the null hypothesis assumes that whatever you are trying to prove did not happen.\n",
